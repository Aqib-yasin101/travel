## 🧭 How It Works

1. The user types a keyword (like `nature`, `culture`, or `beauty`) into the search bar.  
2. JavaScript checks the input and matches it with pre-defined travel categories.  
3. Recommended destinations are displayed below the search box dynamically.  

Example:
- **Input:** “nature” → Recommendations: Hunza Valley, Fairy Meadows, Naran Kaghan  
- **Input:** “culture” → Recommendations: Lahore Fort, Mohenjo-Daro, Badshahi Mosque
